There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea/
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
Oh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)/
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum/
One day, when the tonguing' is done
We'll take our leave and go/
She'd not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore/
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow (huh)/
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum/
One day, when the tonguing' is done
We'll take our leave and go/
Da da da da da
Da da da da da da da/
Da da da da da da da da da da da/
what shall we do with the drunken sailor?
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?/
What shall we do with the drunken sailor
Early in the morning?/
Put him in the long boat till he's sober
Put him in the long boat till he's sober/
Put him in the long boat till he's sober
Early in the morning/
Weigh heigh up she rises
Weigh heigh up she rises/
Weigh heigh up she rises
Early in the morning/
Zing ik ayay, jippie jippie jee,
Zing ik ayay, jippie jippie jee,/
Zing ik ayay, jippie 
ayay, jippie,/
ayay, jippie jippie jee, hiep hoi!/
